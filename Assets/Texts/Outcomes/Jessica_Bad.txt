Although she held a high position in her former company, she had to work her way from the bottom up at her new job.  Her co-workers found that Jessica had been illegally obtaining and stashing large amounts of Adderall at her work desk in order to cope with her stress. Her neighbours have been complaining that she’s a very rude person and often litters the street. She was found to be a frequent animal abuser and banned from adopting pets, but this didn’t stop her from finding wild animals to torture. Therefore, Jessica had a supervisor assigned to her, ensuring she wouldn’t slip up again.
