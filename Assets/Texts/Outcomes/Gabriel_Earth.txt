Gabriel became more anxious, since this was his final shot at getting a new life and recovering from the deaths of his family. He became more reclusive and asocial from his neighbours. As a result, his health deteriorated and he had to take time off of work. Despite his attempts at putting his mind to rest by helping out at the charity, he could not move on from the loss of his wife and daughter. The toll on his mental health became too much and he now spends most of his days watching old videos of his family, living in a fantasy of his previous life, unable to move on.
