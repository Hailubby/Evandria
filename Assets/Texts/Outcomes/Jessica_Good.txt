Due to Jessica’s determination and great work ethic, she quickly climbed up the ranks to a high position within a finance company. However, her strict and intimidating personality creates a great amount of tension between her and her co-workers. Jessica adopted many pets, but all of them have ended up dead. Her neighbours have often witnessed her abusing her pets, so Jessica was banned from adopting any more animals. She has shown that she still has her abusive nature and her neighbours have dubbed her “The Butcher” with a sense of fear descending upon her neighbourhood.
