Thomas continues to completely fill his work schedule and starts to work even harder. He needs to start the music industry on Evandria from scratch and burdens himself with the task to grow the industry. He became stricter with his coworkers hoping to build an industry that won’t easily topple. However this attitude made me very hard to work with as time went on. Although he partially succeeded in building the foundations of the industry, he has no friends or anyone close to celebrate with.
