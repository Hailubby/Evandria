Scott’s current job as a cleaner helped him to clean up some of the garbage that had been littered here and there at Evandria. This improved the quality of the living for the citizens of Evandria. His passion for Arts led to him pursuing a career also in teaching Arts, while his work ethic and charisma motivated people to work harder and be more productive, giving them a bit of happiness, a small but noticeable effect as a whole. His son, Jeffrey, was inspired by his father’s good deeds and wishes to be a great leader in the future.
