Louis opened up a small restaurant for himself and over time, built up a bad reputation for himself as he did not treat his workers well. He was a perfectionist and could not tolerate their incompetence. Many of them had filed work abuse cases against him as he had abused and thrown knives at them in fits of rage, as he was not as successful as he was back on Earth. None of the cases were followed through as the workers who filed them all mysteriously disappear.
