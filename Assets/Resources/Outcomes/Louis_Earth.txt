Louis checks up on his restaurants a lot more now as his TV appearances became less. His staff became more discontent as he became more abusive towards them, with knives now rather than words. Reports were made, but the workers who made them all mysteriously withdrew their accusations, but their arms were always seen with cuts during preliminary investigations. As Louis jumps from relationship to relationship, many of his ex girlfriends have fallen victim to serial murder cases. They all had 15 stabs in their body. Upon further investigation, it was found the culprit behind all these deaths was Louis.
