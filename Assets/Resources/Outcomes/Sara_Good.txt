Sara has been doing much better since she moved to Evandria. She was able to bring her children along and they live with her. Since moving onto this new planet, Sara's regained her position as a teacher for the local primary school and seems to be doing a fantastic job at it. Although she's recovered from drinking wine almost every day, she still has a small glass once a week. Although she's had a rough marriage, things seem to be looking up for Sara and her children, a much better life is ahead of them.
