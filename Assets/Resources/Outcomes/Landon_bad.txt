Although Landon has ambitious innovative ideas, maybe someone should have held him to more well-tested designs for Evandria's infrastructure. Large amounts of money have been spent repairing catastrophic failures in Landon's designs which have failed due to unforeseen flaws. This has severly deteriorated the economy of Evandria. Landon's peers began to take his lead with these risky designs but have been assigned a new leader as his teaching was deemed inadequate. Landon's ideas were walking a fine line and seem to have turned sour.
