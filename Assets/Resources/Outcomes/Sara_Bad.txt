Although Sara has tried her best to adjust to life on Evandria, it seems quite difficult for her. She recently got a job at the local primary school but she was already fired for coming to school hungover. Her children are often left hungry and are seen having dinner at their neighbour's, with Sara nowhere in sight. There are also rumours that Sara has started hitting her children. Although it seemed like Evandria was a good way for Sara to start again, she never took the opportunity and is back to her old habits.
