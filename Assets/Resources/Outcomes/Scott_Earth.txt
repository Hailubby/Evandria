Having been declined a trip with his son Jeffrey to Evandria, this caused a great amount of stress for Scott. He worked even harder so that he could get another chance for the prosperous Evandria. He worked day and night and day and night, even passing out from exhaustion. He had to be taken to hospital, and his son had to take care of himself for a couple days. Scott was still determined, but the stress caught up and he suffered a heart attack, which he did not survive. His son was taken in by an orphanage, with his future unclear.
