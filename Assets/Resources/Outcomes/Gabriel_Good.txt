Gabriel adopted a child and is in a much better place than he was on Earth. Although heâ€™s started his life anew, he keeps his deceased wife and daughter in his heart at all times. Gabriel works as a neurologist at a hospital on Evandria and set up a scholarship program, so that young adolescents will be able to contribute to the development of the planet, just like him. He actively takes part in community events with his child, so that Evandria will be able to prosper, unlike Earth.
