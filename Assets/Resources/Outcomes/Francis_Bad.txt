Francis moved to Evandria, however this change of scene did nothing to change his attitude towards working. He did not find enjoyment in working, even given the opportunity to try to work on new systems on the new planet. After weeks of frustration and unhappyness, Francis decided selfishly to sell his fsociety program to the highest bidder. The purchaser of this program was a powerful banking conglomerate, using the data Francis had compiled, and algorithms he had written, this company were able to optimise their loan system to trap more people into high interest rates and recurring debt. Many people around Evandria struggled following this move, people had to downgrade their housing and take government handouts just to eat. Francis, now a very rich man, was able to settle down comfortably and play games for the rest of his days
