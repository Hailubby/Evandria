Working full time in Evandria has built up a tremendous amount of stress, which is slowly pushing Asuna to her mental limits, with both the pressure from work, and the pressure from her sick sister back on Earth.

Her boyfriend also cannot handle the long distance relationship, and has broken up with her as well.
