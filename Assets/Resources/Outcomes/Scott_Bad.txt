Scott’s passion for the white supremacy led to the formation of a new society on Evandria. The people of Evandria were very unhappy about it. His passion also led him to getting his son into the society, who in turn invited his new friends on Evandria, and they were taught the ways of white supremacy. He still had a strong work ethic, and worked many jobs. However, this affected the economy of Evandria in a small way, taking possible jobs of others who needed them too. He still worked a cleaner’s job, but bad cleaning products caused a bit of environmental damage.
