      <Description>
        Landon is a young man who believes he can do anything, anything you need repaired he'll construct a way to deal with it.
        He's only ever worked one job in his life but his employer restricted him to working by the book to solve problems and wouldn't let him make use of his innovative ideas.
        He sometimes gets ahead of himself and makes unrealistic designs which may not work in practice.
      </Description>
      <background>
        Although his ideas may not always seem to be grounded in real in-use solutions Landon thoroughly researchs his ideas.
        He makes careful calculations to reduce the risk of their failure, but without actually having tested them practically there is no absolute guarantee they will work.
        Taking a chance on a guy like Landon could lead to great technological advancements, but great reward only comes from taking big risks.
