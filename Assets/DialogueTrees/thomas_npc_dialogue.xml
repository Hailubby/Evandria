      <Text>He is a lot more charasmatic than he sounds. I think this is a result of him having to perform in front of others as a musician. He is interesting to talk to and especially captivating when he's performing.</Text>

      <Text>No, not really. He seems to be a hard worker and enjoys his job. He works hard to maintain his fame as a composer but he doesn't let the fame go to his head. He is a rather down to earth person.</Text>

      <Text>Not that I recall, he doesn't cause any trouble around the house. He is relatively clean and always does his share of the chores. Although, sometimes it is a little lonely around here as he is always focused on his work.</Text>
