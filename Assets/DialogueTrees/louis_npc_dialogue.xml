      <Text>Well he is very popular with the ladies. But it is kind of weird, he seems to move on from them pretty fast. I wouldn't be able to if it was me, I'd be devastated.</Text>

      <Text>I'm not too sure. Cooking really does seem like his life as well as women of course. I know he enjoys practising pocket knife tricks and showing it off, he always has it on him.</Text>

      <Text>He is a very proud person and doesn't tolerate anything not up to his standards so he's not very nice to the newbies and criticizes them quite a bit. A lot of them end up leaving because they can't handle it, but the pay is really good.</Text>
