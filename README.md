# Evandria
- Earth is facing overpopulation and resource depletion.  
- People will move to Evandria, but it has limited space.  
- ISC (International Selection Committee) have to select certain people who will be allowed to move.  
- The player, Alex, is a member of ISC and must decide who is able to go to Evandria.  
- Alex must decide between two people per day to send to Evandria.  
- Decisions are critical as who Alex sends to Evandria will shape the community over there.  
- Goal is to keep the “life” of Evandria above a certain threshold (based on Alex’s decision making)
